# Extraction of Gesture Features

This is the repository for all the code that was created during the GSoC 2023 at Red Hen Lab for the project topic "Extraction of Gesture Features.". The main aim of this project is to find the relationship between the body language (gesture) and the sentence(phrase) of a speaker.
