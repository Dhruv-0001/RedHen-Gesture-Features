929	11117	We're back with Bethany Frankel, and switching gears a little bit, so you took your daughter, your precious little genius daughter, to, Bren, to Disney World.
11117	12498	Had she been before?
12498	21886	She had been to Disneyland here, and I had an appearance to do for Skinny World Cocktails down there, which was weird going down to the happiest place on Earth during the middle of the hurricane.
23768	27634	This was every princess, Tinkerbell, Snow White.
27634	28415	We did the whole thing.
28415	30698	We did the lunch at the Princess Castle.
30698	32080	Jason was like, the food's really good.
32080	35906	And he's saying, imagine me out with my guy friends being like, that pasta was amazing in Orlando.
35906	36406	And they'd be like, where?
36406	37428	He'd be like, Princess Castle.
38189	39210	Princesses are everything.
39210	42573	And I literally, you know, I'm not really jaded when I meet celebrities.
42573	44575	I mean, when I meet celebrities, I am jaded.
44575	46437	Because I'll, you know, I've met them.
46437	47438	And I don't get all freaked out.
47438	49700	You're like, Jasmine's coming!
49700	50460	Hurry up!
50460	51181	Like, you freak out.
51181	53383	Prince, get over here with your autographed buckets.
53383	54124	Hurry up!
54124	55205	Like, you're crazy.
55205	56006	Because it's Disney.
56006	57407	And the characters are important.
57407	58268	And you don't get it.
58268	59269	They don't see them that often.
59789	61051	Like a Mickey Mouse.
61051	62312	Mickey Mouse.
62312	63734	Mickey Mouse doesn't come out that often.
63734	65596	Just so you know, you don't walk around Disney.
65596	67258	He only hangs out on Main Street.
67258	69341	He's not like running around accessible.
69341	70042	He's a celebrity.
71824	72905	What is wrong with you?
72905	73365	No, he is.
73365	75147	It's a big deal when you're there.
75147	76427	It's a big deal when you're there.
76427	78589	They're people dressed in costumes.
78589	79510	No, they're not.
79510	80851	No, and they don't break.
80851	81511	No, they're not, Ellen.
81511	83112	They don't break character ever?
83112	83713	Never.
83713	85774	I said to Arielle, didn't we see you before?
85774	91959	Because now she was in her gown after she married the prince and before she was in her mermaid outfit and looked like the same face half hour ago.
91959	95702	She goes, no, my daddy just gave me legs for my birthday.
95702	97003	No, they do not break, Ellen.
97843	99645	But I think that they do at night.
99645	101926	I think there's like a Disney after hours.
101926	102507	You know what I mean?
102507	103848	Princess has gone wild.
103848	104408	Oh, I'm sure.
104408	106149	If you know what I mean.
106149	108051	It gets ugly early, you know?
108051	108751	I'm sure.
108751	108911	Yes.
108911	110032	I'm sure.
110032	111293	And everything is Mickey Mouse.
111293	113335	The carpet has Mickey Mouse in it.
113335	114996	And the shower heads are Mickey Mouse.
114996	116897	And you're like in the Mickey Mouse cult.
116897	117798	I asked someone for mint.
117798	121881	And I swear to you, it was shaped like a mouse.
121881	122161	All right.
125230	127071	Are you excited about your talk show in the fall?
127071	127792	You must be excited.
127792	128672	You're getting close.
128672	131794	I'm very excited.
131794	133895	I am very excited.
133895	134976	I cannot wait.
134976	136877	Are we doing it here or in New York?
136877	137638	What have we decided?
137638	138918	We haven't decided yet.
138918	139999	We haven't decided.
139999	142280	All right, because I haven't heard the latest.
142280	142661	I know.
142661	143761	We haven't decided yet.
143761	147524	It's the kind of thing that it's going to be great no matter where it is.
147524	148304	It's not what you're doing.
148304	148984	It's who you're with.
148984	151006	And it's not where you are, but it's who you're with.
151006	153047	Or it's not where you are, but it's what you're doing.
153047	153187	What?
156101	158684	Are you going to be able to work the rest of the day after this?
158684	160446	I think I've freed you out a little bit.
160446	161287	Thank god it's over.
161287	164970	I want to thank Russell Brand and Hyundai.
164970	171097	And their Hope on Wheels program has funded over 300 research projects to help find a cure for pediatric cancer.
171097	173339	Bethany Frankel, I will see you tomorrow.
173339	174200	Be kind to one another.
174200	174420	Thank you.
174420	174741	Bye bye.
